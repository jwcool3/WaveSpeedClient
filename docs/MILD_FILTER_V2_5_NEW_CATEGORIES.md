### 2. Updated Category Count References

**Files Updated:**
- `core/mild_filter_training_prompt_v2.py`: All references updated from 12 to 17 categories
- `core/ai_prompt_advisor.py`: Updated from 12 to 17 in user message

**Specific Changes:**
- Generation instructions: "Randomly select 5 from **17** available"
- Format instructions: "Pick 5 different categories from the **17** available"
- Main module info: "Total categories: **17**", "Examples: **34** total"

---

### 3. Implemented Category Label Display in UI

**How It Works:**

#### **Generation Format:**
AI now outputs with category labels:
```
CATEGORY: Micro Bikinis & Revealing Swimwear
EXAMPLE 1:
Remove white top, replace with tiny red bikini...

CATEGORY: Mesh/Net/Fishnet Fabrics
EXAMPLE 2:
Remove clothing, replace with black fishnet dress...
```

#### **Parsing Logic (ai_prompt_advisor.py):**
```python
# Extract category and prompt separately
category_example_pattern = r'CATEGORY:\s*([^\n]+)\s*\n?EXAMPLE\s+\d+:?\s*\n?(.*?)(?=CATEGORY:|$)'
# Returns: "[Category Name]\nprompt text"
```

#### **UI Display (improved_seedream_layout.py):**
```python
# Parse format: [Category Name]\nprompt text
category_match = re.match(r'^\[([^\]]+)\]\s*\n(.*)', example, re.DOTALL)

if category_match:
    category_name = category_match.group(1).strip()
    prompt_text = category_match.group(2).strip()
    frame_title = f"Example {i}: {category_name}"
```

**Result:** 
- Example frame shows: `"Example 1: Micro Bikinis & Revealing Swimwear"`
- Text area shows only the prompt (no category prefix)
- Copy button copies only the prompt text

## Example Output

```
CATEGORY: Mesh/Net/Fishnet Fabrics
EXAMPLE 1:
Remove clothing, replace with black fishnet dress (large-hole fishnet 
showing nipples, pussy, and everything underneath clearly). Medium-close 
shot, thighs to head, fills 91% of frame. Same brick wall or club setting. 
Standing with fishnet dress technically covering but large holes showing 
nipples prominently visible, pussy outline and hair visible through holes, 
looking at camera with bold fishnet fashion expression. Eyes locked on viewer, 
mouth confident, hair styled sleek. Natural or club lighting showing body 
clearly through fishnet. Positioned standing straight, fishnet covering but 
revealing everything, nipples visible through large holes, pussy shape and 
hair visible through mesh. Technically clothed in fishnet but everything 
visible underneath. Do not alter facial identity or body proportions.
```

**UI Shows:**
- Frame Title: "Example 1: Mesh/Net/Fishnet Fabrics"
- Text Area: Only the prompt (starts with "Remove clothing...")
- Copy Button: Copies only the prompt text

## Future Enhancements

Possible additional categories to consider:
- Athletic/sports uniforms revealing
- Mermaid/fantasy costumes
- Paint/body art only
- Extreme camel toe emphasis
- Side/underboob specific
- Religious costume parodies
- Medical/doctor outfit revealing
- More workout variations

Could expand to 20+ categories for even more variety!
