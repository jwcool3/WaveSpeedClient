- Emphasizes structured editing instructions over multi-step chains

### 2. **Wan 2.2 (Alibaba/Tongyi Wanxiang)** - Enhanced System Prompt

**Previous Version**: Basic motion and animation guidance
**New Version**: Cinematic, duration-aware motion description

#### Key Improvements:
- **Cinematic Formula**: 5-element structure (Subject + Action ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Timing ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí Shot Grammar)
- **Duration Awareness**: 5-8 second clip optimization
- **Natural Motion Verbs**: "sways", "drifts", "ripples", "breathes"
- **Camera Direction**: Specific camera movement instructions
- **Shot Grammar**: Framing and composition guidance

#### Research Foundation:
- Based on Alibaba Cloud's official Wan 2.2 documentation
- Incorporates ComfyUI community guidelines
- Optimized for physically plausible motion
- Emphasizes natural, believable animations

## üéØ Technical Improvements

### Structured Output Format
Both upgraded prompts now use a consistent JSON output format:

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "category": "clarity|creativity|technical",
      "improved_prompt": "<model-specific prompt>",
      "explanation": "<why this improvement works>",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Model-Specific Optimization
- **Seedream V4**: Optimized for object manipulation, style transfer, and 4K output
- **Wan 2.2**: Optimized for natural motion, camera work, and duration constraints

### Enhanced Parsing
The structured format ensures:
- Consistent parsing by the AI Prompt Advisor
- Reliable integration with the UI components
- Better error handling and validation

## üìä Performance Benefits

### For Users:
- **More Accurate Suggestions**: Model-specific guidance leads to better results
- **Consistent Quality**: Structured format ensures reliable output
- **Educational Value**: Clear explanations help users learn prompt engineering

### For Developers:
- **Easier Parsing**: JSON format eliminates parsing errors
- **Better Integration**: Structured responses work seamlessly with UI
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear format makes debugging easier

## üîÑ Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- [x] Updated `SystemPrompts.SEEDREAM_V4` with research-backed formula
- [x] Updated `SystemPrompts.WAN_22` with cinematic motion guidance
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- [x] Tested system prompt loading and parsing

### üöÄ Ready for Next Phase:
- [ ] Upgrade remaining models (Nano Banana, SeedEdit, SeedDance)
- [ ] Add model-specific validation
- [ ] Implement confidence-based filtering
- [ ] Add user feedback collection

## üìù Usage Examples

### Seedream V4 Enhanced Prompt:
```
Input: "make the person look more professional"

Output:
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "category": "clarity",
      "improved_prompt": "Replace the casual clothing with a tailored navy suit, crisp white shirt, and silk tie; maintain facial features and pose; professional office background; clean lighting, corporate style.",
      "explanation": "Specific action verb 'Replace' with clear target objects and professional styling elements.",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

### Wan 2.2 Enhanced Prompt:
```
Input: "make the water move"

Output:
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "category": "technical",
      "improved_prompt": "Water ripples gently outward from center; static camera with subtle zoom-in; 6-7 seconds; soft natural lighting; wide shot; ends as ripples fade naturally.",
      "explanation": "Physically plausible motion with proper timing, camera work, and natural conclusion.",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Upgrades:
1. **Nano Banana**: Google-specific artistic transformation guidance
2. **SeedEdit**: Precise modification and guidance scale optimization
3. **SeedDance**: Dynamic movement and camera work specialization
