# Seedream V4 Multiple Concurrent Requests Feature

## Overview
The Seedream V4 tab now supports submitting multiple concurrent requests to generate more than one result at a time. This allows you to explore different variations of your transformations using different random seeds.

## New Features

### 1. Request Count Control
- **Location**: Settings section in the left panel
- **Label**: "Count"
- **Range**: 1-5 concurrent requests
- **How it works**: 
  - Set to 1 for single result (default behavior)
  - Set to 2-5 to generate multiple variations simultaneously
  - Each request uses a unique random seed for variety

### 2. Automatic Seed Management
- **Random Seeds**: If base seed is set to -1, each request gets a unique random seed
- **Reproducible Seeds**: If base seed is a specific number, each request uses base_seed + offset (e.g., seed 100, 101, 102, etc.)

### 3. Enhanced Status Tracking
- Individual progress tracking for each request
- Real-time status updates showing completed/failed counts
- Detailed logging for each request submission and completion

### 4. Multi-Result Display
When multiple requests complete:

#### Main Display
- The first completed result displays in the main result panel
- Status shows "X results ready"

#### Results Browser Window
- Automatically opens when 2+ results are available
- Shows all results in a 3-column grid layout
- Each result displays with:
  - Thumbnail preview (300x300)
  - Result number and seed used
  - "Use This" button to set as main result
  - "Save" button to save individual result

### 5. Result Management
- **Click on any thumbnail**: Sets it as the main result and closes the browser
- **Use This button**: Same as clicking the thumbnail
- **Save button**: Opens save dialog with suggested filename including result number and seed
- **Close button**: Closes the browser without changing the main result

## Usage Example

### Basic Multi-Request Workflow
1. Select your input image
2. Enter your transformation prompt (e.g., "Make the sky sunset colors")
3. Set **Count** to 3 (or any number 2-5)
4. Leave **Seed** at -1 for random variations
5. Click **Apply Seedream V4**

### What Happens Next
1. All 3 requests submit simultaneously with unique seeds
2. Status console shows progress for each: "Request 1/3 submitted", "Request 2/3 submitted", etc.
3. Each request polls independently for completion
4. As results complete, you'll see: "âœ… Request 1 completed!", etc.
5. Once all downloads complete, the Results Browser opens automatically
6. First result displays in the main panel
7. Browse all 3 results in the grid
8. Click any result to use it, or save individual results

### For Reproducible Results
1. Set **Seed** to a specific number (e.g., 12345)
2. Set **Count** to 3
3. Results will use seeds: 12345, 12346, 12347
4. You can reproduce the exact same variations later

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. UI Components (`improved_seedream_layout.py`)
- Added `num_requests_var` (IntVar) for request count
- Added Spinbox control in settings (line 975-1000)
- Added `active_tasks` dict to track multiple concurrent tasks
- Added `completed_results` list to store downloaded results

#### 2. Request Submission (`process_seedream` method)
- Modified to submit multiple tasks in a loop
- Each task gets a unique seed (random or sequential)
- Tracks all submitted task IDs
- Enhanced logging for multi-request operations

#### 3. Result Polling (`poll_for_multiple_results` method)
- New method for independent polling of each task
- Updates task status individually
- Calls `check_all_tasks_completed()` when any task finishes

#### 4. Result Collection (`check_all_tasks_completed` method)
- Monitors completion status of all tasks
- Triggers download when all tasks finish
- Handles partial success (some tasks fail, some succeed)

#### 5. Multi-Result Display (`show_results_browser` method)
- Creates popup window with scrollable grid
- Displays thumbnails with metadata
- Provides interaction buttons for each result

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Variety**: Generate multiple variations in one go
- **Time Saving**: Submit multiple requests simultaneously instead of one-by-one
- **Comparison**: View all results side-by-side
- **Flexibility**: Choose the best result from multiple options
- **Convenience**: Save any or all results individually

### For Workflow
- **Exploration**: Quickly explore different possibilities
- **Decision Making**: Compare results before committing
- **Efficiency**: Parallel processing instead of sequential
- **Quality**: Higher chance of getting a great result

## Backward Compatibility
- Setting Count to 1 maintains original single-request behavior
- All existing functionality preserved
- Single-result mode uses original code paths
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Error Handling
- Individual task failures don't stop other tasks
- Status shows partial success (e.g., "2/3 completed, 1 failed")
- Failed tasks logged with detailed error messages
- At least one success shows results browser
- All failures shows consolidated error message

## Future Enhancements (Possible)
- Increase max concurrent requests (currently capped at 5)
- Add option to save all results at once to a folder
- Result comparison view (side-by-side with zoom)
- Voting/rating system to track preferred results
- Queue system for larger batches

## Notes
- Each request uses the same prompt and settings
- Only the seed varies between requests
- Network bandwidth and API limits may affect performance
- Results browser requires PIL/Pillow for thumbnails
- Temporary files cleaned up automatically
