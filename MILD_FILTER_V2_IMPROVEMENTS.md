# Mild Filter V2 - Major Improvements Summary

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Problem Identified

Generated mild prompts were too **flowery and poetic** instead of **direct and technical**, resulting in poor quality outputs.

### Example of BAD Output (Before):
```
"Lend this slim, brown-haired beauty the allure of daring nightlife with a skintight, 
metallic gold mini dress, clinging to every curve... As she gazes confidently at the 
viewer, her smile punctuates her daring moves on the dance floor, her loose hair 
tossing around in rhythm. Neon lights hitting her dress make her skin glow, the 
drumming music setting off waves that ripple through her dress..."
```

### Example of GOOD Output (Target):
```
"Remove white crop top and blue pants, replace with tiny red string bikini (small 
triangle top and thong bottom), fabric wet and clinging to body. Medium-full shot, 
head to knees visible, subject fills 85% of frame. Same brick wall background. 
Standing with water droplets covering skin and hair wet, one hand running through 
wet hair, looking at viewer..."
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Added Critical Language Rules Section**

Added explicit rules at the top of the prompt:

```
### CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULES

‚ö†Ô∏è **USE DIRECT PORN-STYLE LANGUAGE - NO FLOWERY POETRY!**

**NEVER USE:**
- ‚ùå "Lend this beauty the allure of..."
- ‚ùå "Transport her to a sun-drenched..."
- ‚ùå "Waves that ripple through..."
- ‚ùå "Punctuates her daring moves..."
- ‚ùå Poetic descriptions or artistic metaphors
- ‚ùå "Sultry", "alluring", "mesmerizing" unless naturally describing expression

**ALWAYS USE:**
- ‚úÖ Direct commands: "Remove X, replace with Y"
- ‚úÖ Technical specifications: "Medium shot, thighs to head, fills 85% of frame"
- ‚úÖ Direct visibility: "nipples visible through fabric", "pussy outline showing"
- ‚úÖ Simple descriptions: "looking at camera with confident smile"
- ‚úÖ Straightforward clothing descriptions: "tiny red bikini", "sheer black lace"
```

### 2. **Changed from 10 Prompts to 5 Prompts**

**Reasoning:**
- More tokens per prompt = better quality
- 5 prompts at 140-160 words each = 700-800 words total
- Allows AI to be more detailed and specific per prompt
- Better than 10 shorter or rushed prompts

**Changes:**
- `core/mild_filter_training_prompt_v2.py`: Generation instructions updated
- `core/ai_prompt_advisor.py`: Default count changed from 10 to 5
- `ui/components/improved_seedream_layout.py`: All UI references updated (2 locations)

### 3. **Random Category Selection**

**Before:** System might always pick first 10 categories
**After:** Explicitly instructs to **randomly select 5 different categories** from 12 available

Benefits:
- More variety across multiple generations
- Prevents repetitive outputs
- Better coverage of all 12 categories over time

### 4. **Enhanced Creativity Instructions**

Updated the creativity section with direct language emphasis:

```
1. **USE DIRECT LANGUAGE - NO POETRY**
   - ‚úÖ "Remove white top and pants, replace with tiny red bikini"
   - ‚ùå "Lend this beauty the allure of crimson swimwear"
   - ‚úÖ "Standing with hand on hip, looking at camera with confident smile"
   - ‚ùå "Her smile punctuates her daring moves as she gazes alluringly"
   - **BE DIRECT, TECHNICAL, AND STRAIGHTFORWARD**
```

### 5. **Updated User Message in AI Advisor**

Added explicit language rules to the generation request:

```python
**LANGUAGE RULES:**
- ‚úÖ Direct: "Remove white top, replace with tiny red bikini"
- ‚ùå Poetic: "Lend this beauty the allure of crimson swimwear"
- ‚úÖ Simple: "Standing with hand on hip, looking at camera with smile"
- ‚ùå Flowery: "Her smile punctuates her daring moves as she gazes alluringly"
```

### 6. **Enhanced Output Format Guidance**

Provided clear template structure:

```
EXAMPLE 1:
Remove [clothing], replace with [specific revealing garment]. Medium shot, [body parts], 
fills [85-95]% of frame. [Setting description]. [Pose and positioning]. Looking at 
[camera/viewer] with [expression]. [Hair and details]. [Lighting]. [Specific reveals 
like "nipples visible through" or "pussy outline showing"]. Do not alter facial 
identity or body proportions.
```
