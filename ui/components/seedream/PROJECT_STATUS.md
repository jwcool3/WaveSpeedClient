## 🏗️ Final Architecture

### Pattern: Manager Self-Setup ✅

```python
SeedreamLayoutV2 (Coordinator - 933 lines)
├── Creates frame structure
├── Calls manager.setup_*() methods
└── Forwards attributes for compatibility

Managers (Self-Contained)
├── ImageSectionManager → set_ui_references(widgets)
├── SettingsPanelManager → setup_settings_panel(frame)
├── PromptSectionManager → setup_prompt_section(frame)
├── ActionsHandlerManager → setup_actions_section(frame)
├── FilterTrainingManager → integrated via prompts
└── ResultsDisplayManager → result handling
```

**Key Insight**: Each manager creates its own UI and manages its own logic. The coordinator just brings them together.

---

## 🔧 Implementation Journey

### Challenges Encountered & Resolved

#### Issue 1: Missing setup_ui_widgets() ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Tried to pass UI widgets to managers  
**Solution**: Let managers create their own UI via `setup_*()` methods

#### Issue 2: prompt_text Property Conflict ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Read-only @property prevented manager from setting attribute  
**Solution**: Removed @property, added attribute forwarding after UI setup

#### Issue 3: Non-existent Callbacks ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Tried to wire callbacks that managers don't have  
**Solution**: Simplified `_connect_modules()` - managers are self-contained

**Result**: All issues resolved, system working perfectly!
